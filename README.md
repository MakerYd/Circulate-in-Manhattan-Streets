## Circulate-in-Manhattan-Streets

The project deals with traffic in the streets of Manhattan, and therefore the goal will be to simulate the movements of vehicles in streets that are
perpendicular To carry out this project, we will have to process the mobility simulation for each of the following steps:
#- Simulate the street network using NetLogo patches.
#- Create and position vehicles on the streets of Manhattan.
#- Simulate the random movement of vehicles in the streets of Manhattan.
#- Guarantee that each vehicle has a starting junction but also an arrival junction.
#- Optimize the movement of vehicles in the streets of Manhattan.
